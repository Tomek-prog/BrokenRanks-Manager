## üîë Licensing & Activation

### How does licensing work?

Each license is **bound to your hardware** using a Hardware ID (HWID):
- HWID is a hash of: motherboard UUID, CPU ID, MAC address, Windows Product ID
- License can only be used on the PC where it was first activated
- **One license = One PC** (cannot share)

### Can I use my license on multiple PCs?

**No.** Licenses are HWID-bound and cannot be transferred or shared.

If you need multiple PCs:
- Purchase separate licenses
- Or contact support for multi-PC discounts

### What if I format my PC?

**HWID Reset Available:**
- Each license includes **1 free HWID reset**
- Contact support: support@adminjaska.ovh
- Provide your license key and reason
- Reset processed within 24-48 hours

**After the free reset:**
- Additional resets: 50 PLN each
- Or purchase a new license

### What if I upgrade my hardware?

**Minor upgrades** (RAM, GPU, storage):
- HWID remains the same
- License continues working

**Major upgrades** (motherboard, CPU):
- HWID changes
- License stops working
- Use your free HWID reset

### I lost my license key. Can I retrieve it?

**Yes!**
- Check your email (subject: "Your BrokenRanks-Manager License")
- Contact support with your purchase email
- We'll resend your license key

### Can I transfer my license to someone else?

**No.** Licenses are **non-transferable** and **personal**.

Attempting to share or sell your license violates the [LICENSE](../LICENSE) agreement and may result in:
- Immediate license revocation
- No refund
- Potential legal action

## üíª Technical Questions

### What are the system requirements?

**Minimum:**
- Windows 10 (64-bit)
- 4 GB RAM
- 500 MB storage
- Internet connection

**Recommended:**
- Windows 11 (64-bit)
- 8 GB RAM
- 1 GB storage
- Stable internet

### Why does my antivirus block the bot?

This is a **false positive**. The bot uses:
- Screen capture (to read game state)
- Keyboard/mouse simulation (to control the game)
- Process monitoring (to detect game window)

These behaviors can trigger antivirus software.

**Solution:**
Add the bot folder to your antivirus **exclusions/exceptions**.

See [Installation Guide](INSTALLATION.md#antivirus-configuration) for detailed instructions.

### Can I run the bot on a virtual machine (VM)?

**Not recommended.**
- HWID may change on VM reboot
- VM performance degrades image recognition
- Some VM software is detected and blocked

If you must use a VM:
- Ensure stable HWID (fixed MAC, UUID)
- Use powerful host machine
- Test with Trial license first

### Does the bot work with Remote Desktop (RDP)?

**Limited support.**
- RDP may interfere with screen capture
- Input simulation may not work correctly
- Local desktop recommended

### Can I run multiple bot instances?

**No.** One bot instance per license.

Running multiple instances:
- Requires multiple licenses
- Not officially supported (high CPU usage)
- May cause detection issues

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Questions

### Can I modify the bot code?

Reverse engineering, decompilation, or modification is **strictly prohibited** by the [LICENSE](../LICENSE) agreement and may result in:
- License revocation
- Legal action
- Criminal prosecution

### Can I create my own image templates?

**Yes!**
- Take screenshots in-game

### How does HWID work technically?

**HWID Generation:**
```
Components collected:
- Motherboard UUID (via WMIC)
- CPU Processor ID
- MAC Address (first adapter)
- Windows Product ID
- Computer Name

Combined hash:
SHA-256(MB_UUID + CPU_ID + MAC + WIN_ID + NAME)
= 64-character hex string
```

**Why this method:**
- Cannot be easily spoofed
- Survives minor hardware changes
- Changes on major hardware upgrades

### Can I see the bot source code?

**No.** BrokenRanks-Manager is **proprietary software** with **all rights reserved**.
